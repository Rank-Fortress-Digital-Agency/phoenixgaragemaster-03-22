            are often seen as a simple, straightforward part of the home. But
            there is much more to them than meets the eye. Many signs indicate
            your garage door needs repairs and you should take a look at it now
            before anything bad happens. If your spring tensioner is lost or
            worn out this will cause an immediate problem with opening and
            closing the door because there won’t be enough power to do so
            properly. Another sign that may indicate your garage door needs
            repairs is if you notice any dents in the metal panels on either
            side of the opening- these can cause major problems by getting stuck
            when they close over time and not stay closed without assistance
            from someone else.

            If There Are Any Cracks In The Sealant Around Your Garage Door, This
            Can Lead To Water Damage Inside Your Home
          </h2>
          <p>
            The sealant around your garage door is important for protecting the
            wood on the frame and preventing water from seeping in. When you see
            cracks, it’s time to call a professional to fix them before they
            worsen. They can be expensive but will save you money long-term by
            preserving the life of your garage door.
          </p>
          <p>
            Water damage is never good when trying to maintain a home. It means
            that there are leaks or problems with your roof which need repairs
            before they get worse or cause more trouble down the line. A leaky
            roof typically isn’t going to show any signs until after it starts
            leaking inside. By then, it’s too late and very difficult to repair
            without replacing parts of the roofing system or entire sections of
            siding if it’s a problem with the flashing.

            Check That All Cables Are Tight By Pulling Them With Both Hands
            While Someone Else Holds The Door Closed From Opening
          </h2>
          <p>
            Garage doors are necessary for safety purposes and convenience, but
            problems can arise. A garage door may not open when you want it to
            or could get stuck in the process of opening. If a garage door is
            damaged, it will require repairs before it can function properly
            again. Many signs indicate your garage door needs repairs such as
            cables that won’t pull tight enough, a bent track on the ceiling, an
            unbalanced door due to misalignment with the floor, an opener that
            takes too long to close or raise the door after use, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the door is hard to open or close, it might be a sign to call
            Phoenix Garage Master. We are a professional garage door repair
            company that can help you with any repair that is needed. Regardless
            of the size or weight of your garage door, we have the experience
            and expertise to get the job done. We also carry a wide range of
            parts for doors of all makes and models, so we can usually make the
